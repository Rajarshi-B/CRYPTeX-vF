# CRYPTeX-vF
A Cryptography GUI App made as a pet project(fun) using python. Can be used to encrypt text and small binary files. Uses standard AES-256 primarily. On top of which a Shift Cipher can be used to completely obfuscate the AES-Output and even be converted to a One-Time-Pad if the shift cipher's key is random. Code is badly written :P
